How to use this DT and build your ROM ?

Clone Vendor Tree, Device Tree, Kernel Source to your working dir 
Apply all the patches !

How to lunch now ?
Copy the below codes in termianl 
cd working_dir
. build/envsetup.sh
export LC_ALL=C
export USE_CCACHE=1
lunch lineage_k5fpr-userdebug && make bacon -j10
 
Now one more important thing... 
As we have nuked SePolicy you will have to make kernel permissive to do so get to your kernel dir i.e for eg (android/lineage/kernel)
After that locate to arch/arm64/configs
Open those deconfig files and look for this CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y 
Just copy this code just below it CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_PERMISSIVE=y
Do same for all the files but one thing is for sure this code will be there at last close to end.
This code will make kernel permissive or else you will not able to boot into device!
