## Note 

# Patches may not get applied automatically you will have to read our build manual how to apply those ! 
# However you can try to apply those by using following command:
cd WORKING_DIR
> Here in our case it was cd android/dot

sh device/lenovo/k5fpr/patches/install.sh
# To uninstall those you copy below code :
cd WORKING_DIR
> Here in our case it was cd android/dot
sh device/lenovo/k5fpr/patches/uninstall.sh

# This was patch directory
